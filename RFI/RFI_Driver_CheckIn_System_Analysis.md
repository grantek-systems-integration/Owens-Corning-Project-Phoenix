# RFI SECTION: DRIVER CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT SYSTEM - LAUREL FACILITY
## Critical Operational and Technical Requirements Analysis

---

## FUNDAMENTAL UNKNOWNS

### The Core Issue
The RFQ mentions a "Driver Check-in Application" with load cell integration but provides no context about:
- Current process and pain points
- Supervision model (attended/unattended)
- Scale system specifications
- Network infrastructure at truck areas
- Failure handling procedures
- Integration with transportation/logistics systems

---

## 1. SCALE/LOAD CELL SYSTEM ASSESSMENT

### 1.1 Existing Scale Infrastructure
**What load cell/scale system currently exists?**

**Scale Hardware Questions:**
- [ ] **Scale Manufacturer & Model**: (Rice Lake, Mettler Toledo, Fairbanks, etc.?)
- [ ] **Number of Scales**: Single scale or multiple (inbound/outbound)?
- [ ] **Scale Capacity**: Maximum weight capacity?
- [ ] **Scale Type**: Truck scale, rail scale, or both?
- [ ] **Age/Condition**: Modern digital or legacy analog?

**Scale Controller/Indicator:**
- [ ] **Controller Type**: Digital weight indicator model?
- [ ] **Communication Capability**: 
  - Serial (RS-232/RS-485)?
  - Ethernet?
  - Proprietary protocol?
  - Analog only?
- [ ] **Current Integration**: Connected to any system now?
- [ ] **Data Available**:
  - Weight only?
  - Date/time stamp?
  - Truck ID capability?
  - Multi-weight storage?

### 1.2 Current Scale Operation
**How do scales operate today?**

**Manual Process:**
```
Current State (Assumed):
1. Truck arrives
2. Driver stops at scale house?
3. Operator records weight manually?
4. Paper ticket issued?
5. Truck proceeds to load/unload
6. Return to scale for out-weight?
7. Net weight calculated?
8. Documentation completed?
```

**Key Questions:**
- [ ] Is there currently a scale house with operator?
- [ ] Are drivers supervised during weighing?
- [ ] What documentation is created?
- [ ] How is data entered into systems?
- [ ] What validations occur?

### 1.3 Integration Requirements
**How should Ignition interface with scales?**

## 2. SUPERVISION & ACCESS MODEL

### 2.1 Attended vs. Unattended Operation
**Critical: Will drivers use this unsupervised?**

- Most secure/reliable

**Scenario B: Semi-Attended (Remote Operator)**
```
[Driver] → [Kiosk] ← [Remote Operator] → [System]
                ↑
            [Camera/Intercom]
```
Implications:
- Remote supervision via video
- Driver self-service with help
- Centralized operators
- Moderate security

**Scenario C: Fully Unattended**
```
[Driver] → [Self-Service Kiosk] → [System]
```
Implications:
- 24/7 operation possible
- Lower operating cost
- Higher fraud risk
- More robust system required
- Complex error handling

- [ ] Pre-registration required?
- [ ] How to handle new/unknown drivers?
- [ ] Lost credential procedures?

### 2.3 User Interface Requirements

  - Touchscreen only?
- [ ] **Languages**: English only? Spanish? French (for Sacopan)?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: ADA compliance required?

**Mobile Interface:**
- [ ] Drivers use personal devices?
- [ ] Company-provided tablets?
- [ ] Web-based or native app?
- [ ] Offline capability needed?
