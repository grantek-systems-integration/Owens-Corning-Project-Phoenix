# SAP S4/HANA Integration Proposal
## Project Phoenix - Doors Division Integration

---

### Executive Summary

This proposal addresses the SAP S4/HANA integration requirements for Owens Corning's Project Phoenix, focusing on the migration of four Masonite doors manufacturing facilities to the S4/HANA platform. Given the critical uncertainties identified in our analysis, we propose a risk-managed, phased approach that prioritizes proven technologies while maintaining flexibility for emerging solutions.

**Key Proposal Elements:**
- Dual-path architecture supporting both REST API and Kafka integration
- Comprehensive error handling to support S4's "Clean Core" principle
- Phased deployment strategy with clear go/no-go decision points
- Production-ready fallback options for all critical components

---

## 1. Integration Architecture

### 1.1 Proposed Dual-Path Strategy

Given the unproven nature of Ignition 8.3's Event Streams module and the aggressive timeline, we propose implementing parallel integration paths:

#### Primary Path Architecture (Production-Ready)

    style WHQ fill:#99ff99,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Primary Path Message Flow:**

1. **Downstream (S4 → Sites):**
   - S4/HANA publishes production orders and master data
   - Azure APIM receives and routes messages to WHQ BE
   - WHQ BE Ignition instance processes and distributes messages
   - Messages written to each site's MessageInbound table
   - Site gateway scripts scan MessageInbound table continuously
   - Local processing and plant floor integration occurs
   - Results written to MessageOutbound table

2. **Upstream (Sites → S4):**
   - Site operations generate confirmations/transactions
   - Gateway scripts write to MessageOutbound table
   - WHQ BE scans all site MessageOutbound tables
   - WHQ consolidates and validates messages
   - Sends to APIM for S4/HANA processing
   - Handles responses and error management

**Message Table Architecture:**

```sql
-- MessageInbound Table Structure
CREATE TABLE MessageInbound (
    message_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    message_type VARCHAR(50),
    payload JSONB,
    source_system VARCHAR(50),
    target_site VARCHAR(50),
    created_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    processed_flag BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    processed_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    error_message TEXT
);

-- MessageOutbound Table Structure  
CREATE TABLE MessageOutbound (
    message_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    message_type VARCHAR(50),
    payload JSONB,
    source_site VARCHAR(50),
    target_system VARCHAR(50),
    created_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    transmitted_flag BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    transmitted_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    response_payload JSONB,
    status VARCHAR(20)
);
```

**Rationale for Primary Path:**
- Proven message queue pattern with database persistence
- Reliable store-and-forward mechanism
- Site autonomy during network disruptions
- Traceable message flow with full audit trail
- Simplified troubleshooting and recovery
- No dependency on unproven Event Streams technology

#### Gateway Script Processing Pattern

**WHQ BE Message Router Scripts:**

```python
# Scheduled script running every 30 seconds
def distributeInboundMessages():
    """WHQ BE: Distribute S4 messages to appropriate sites"""
    messages = system.db.runQuery("SELECT * FROM sap_messages WHERE distributed = false")
    
    for message in messages:
        site = determineTargetSite(message)
        payload = {
            'order_number': message['order_number'],
            'material': message['material'],
            'quantity': message['quantity'],
            'routing': message['routing']
        }
        
        # Write to site's MessageInbound table
        siteDB = f"{site}_MES_DB"
        system.db.runPrepUpdate(
            "INSERT INTO MessageInbound (message_type, payload, source_system, target_site) VALUES (?,?,?,?)",
            [message['type'], json.dumps(payload), 'S4_HANA', site],
            database=siteDB
        )
        
        # Mark as distributed
        system.db.runPrepUpdate(
            "UPDATE sap_messages SET distributed = true WHERE id = ?",
            [message['id']]
        )
```

**Site MES BE Processing Scripts:**

```python
# Site gateway script running every 10 seconds
def processInboundMessages():
    """Site MES: Process messages from WHQ"""
    unprocessed = system.db.runQuery(
        "SELECT * FROM MessageInbound WHERE processed_flag = false ORDER BY created_timestamp"
    )
    
    for message in unprocessed:
        try:
            if message['message_type'] == 'PRODUCTION_ORDER':
                processProductionOrder(message['payload'])
            elif message['message_type'] == 'MATERIAL_MASTER':
                updateMaterialMaster(message['payload'])
            
            # Mark as processed
            system.db.runPrepUpdate(
                "UPDATE MessageInbound SET processed_flag = true, processed_timestamp = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE message_id = ?",
                [message['message_id']]
            )
        except Exception as e:
            # Log error and increment retry count
            handleProcessingError(message['message_id'], str(e))
```

**Site Outbound Message Generation:**

```python
def createConfirmationMessage(orderNumber, quantity, workCenter):
    """Site MES: Create confirmation message for S4"""
    payload = {
        'order_number': orderNumber,
        'confirmed_quantity': quantity,
        'work_center': workCenter,
        'timestamp': system.date.now(),
        'site': system.tag.read('[System]Client/Network/Hostname').value
    }
    
    system.db.runPrepUpdate(
        "INSERT INTO MessageOutbound (message_type, payload, source_site, target_system) VALUES (?,?,?,?)",
        ['PRODUCTION_CONFIRMATION', json.dumps(payload), site_name, 'S4_HANA']
    )
```

#### Future Path Architecture (Kafka/Event Streams)

Once Ignition 8.3 Event Streams module is validated and production-ready, the architecture will evolve to leverage real-time event streaming:

**Future Path Key Components:**

1. **SAP Datasphere Integration:**
   - Datasphere acts as the integration layer with S4/HANA
   - All S4 data streams exposed as Kafka topics
   - Handles complex S4 transformations and business logic
   - Provides topic governance and schema management

3. **Ignition Event Streams UDTs:**
   ```python
   # Production Order UDT Structure
   ProductionOrderUDT = {
       'OrderNumber': String,
       'Material': String,
       'Quantity': Float,
       'UOM': String,
       'WorkCenter': String,
       'PlannedStart': DateTime,
       'PlannedEnd': DateTime,
       'Priority': Integer,
       'CustomerOrder': String,
       'EventTimestamp': DateTime,
       'EventType': String  # CREATE, UPDATE, RELEASE, CLOSE
   }
   
   # Confirmation UDT Structure
   ConfirmationUDT = {
       'OrderNumber': String,
       'Operation': String,
       'ConfirmedQty': Float,
       'ScrapQty': Float,

       'BatchNumber': String,
       'Timestamp': DateTime,
       'EventType': String  # GOODS_RECEIPT, GOODS_ISSUE, TRANSFER
   }
   ```

4. **Direct Machine Integration:**
   - PLCs publish directly to Event Streams via UDTs
   - Automatic confirmations triggered by production events
   - Real-time quality data streaming
   - No intermediate database polling required

**Advantages of Future Path:**
- Real-time data flow (sub-second latency)
- Scalable to thousands of devices
- Event-driven architecture
- Reduced database load
- Native S4 integration via Datasphere
- Standardized data models via UDTs
- Automatic schema evolution support

**Migration Strategy from Primary to Future Path:**
1. Run both paths in parallel initially
2. Gradually migrate topic by topic
3. Validate data consistency
4. Sunset database polling once stable
5. Full cutover after 3-month parallel run

**Prerequisites for Future Path:**
- Ignition 8.3 stable release
- Event Streams module production validation
- Datasphere Kafka topics configured
- Kafka infrastructure deployed
- Schema registry implemented
- UDT templates developed and tested

### 1.2 Core Integration Transactions

The system will support the specific 4-step transaction sequence defined in the RFQ:

#### Transaction 1: Production Order Confirmation
- **Direction:** Ignition → S4/HANA
- **API:** `OP_API_PROD_ORDER_CONFIRMATIO_2_SRV_0001`
- **API Reference:** https://api.sap.com/api/OP_API_PROD_ORDER_CONFIRMATIO_2_SRV_0001/overview
- **Trigger:** Operator confirmation or automatic count threshold
- **Process:**
  - Confirms production quantities against production order
  - Automatically generates Goods Receipt (GR) 
  - Creates Inbound Delivery (IBD) if storage location is EWM-managed
  - Updates production order status and remaining quantities
- **Data Elements:**
  - Production order number
  - Operation sequence number
  - Confirmed quantity (good + scrap)
  - Work center and posting date
  - Batch/lot information
- **Error Handling:** Transaction rollback on failure, retry queue for network issues

#### Transaction 2: Handling Unit Creation
- **Direction:** Ignition → S4/HANA
- **API:** `OP_HANDLINGUNIT_0001` (CREATE operation)
- **API Reference:** https://api.sap.com/api/OP_HANDLINGUNIT_0001/overview
- **Trigger:** Successful production order confirmation
- **Process:**
  - Creates handling unit (HU) for confirmed production
  - Assigns HU number and HU type
  - Links HU to production order and material
  - Establishes packaging hierarchy if required
- **Data Elements:**
  - HU number (system-generated)
  - HU type and packaging material
  - Content quantity and material
  - Plant and storage location
- **Dependencies:** Requires successful Transaction 1 completion
- **Error Handling:** Delete/reverse HU creation on downstream failures

#### Transaction 3: Pack HU onto Inbound Delivery
- **Direction:** Ignition → S4/HANA
- **API:** `OP_HANDLINGUNIT_0001` (PACK operation)
- **API Reference:** https://api.sap.com/api/OP_HANDLINGUNIT_0001/overview
- **Trigger:** Successful HU creation
- **Process:**
  - Assigns handling unit to inbound delivery
  - Updates inbound delivery item quantities
  - Sets delivery status to "HU assigned"
  - Links physical package to logistics document
- **Data Elements:**
  - Handling unit number (from Transaction 2)
  - Inbound delivery number
  - Delivery item number
  - Packaging quantities
- **Dependencies:** Requires successful Transactions 1 & 2 completion
- **Error Handling:** Unpack HU from delivery on downstream failure

#### Transaction 4: Post Goods Receipt for Inbound Delivery
- **Direction:** Ignition → S4/HANA
- **API:** `OP_API_INBOUND_DELIVERY_SRV_0002` (PostGoodsReceipt)
- **API Reference:** https://api.sap.com/api/OP_API_INBOUND_DELIVERY_SRV_0002/path/post_PostGoodsReceipt
- **Trigger:** Successful HU packing to inbound delivery
- **Process:**
  - Posts final goods receipt for inbound delivery
  - Updates stock quantities in target storage location
  - Completes the EWM warehouse task (if applicable)
  - Finalizes the production-to-stock process
- **Data Elements:**
  - Inbound delivery number
  - Goods receipt quantities
  - Posting date and document date
  - Storage location and batch information
- **Dependencies:** Requires successful Transactions 1, 2 & 3 completion
- **Error Handling:** Reverse goods receipt on final validation failure

#### Critical Transaction Sequence Requirements

**Sequential Execution:**
```
Step 1: Production Confirmation → Creates GR + IBD (if EWM)
   ↓
Step 2: HU Creation → Creates handling unit for produced goods
   ↓  
Step 3: Pack HU → Assigns HU to inbound delivery
   ↓
Step 4: Post GR → Final goods receipt posting
```

**Transaction Integrity:**
- Each step validates previous step completion
- Failure at any step triggers compensation logic
- Complete audit trail maintained for all attempts
- Rollback procedures defined for each transaction type

**EWM Storage Location Handling:**
- System detects EWM-managed storage locations
- Automatically triggers IBD creation during confirmation
- Handles warehouse task creation and completion
- Supports both EWM and non-EWM scenarios seamlessly

### 1.3 Authentication & Security

**Proposed Security Architecture:**
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with Azure AD integration
- Certificate-based service authentication for production
- API key management with rotation policy
- Encrypted credential storage in Ignition
- Rate limiting and throttling compliance

---

## 2. Error Handling Strategy (Clean Core Compliance)

### 2.1 APIM-Aware Error Management Framework

The S4/HANA "Clean Core" principle requires all error handling to occur outside SAP. However, routing through Azure APIM creates an additional challenge: **limited visibility into actual SAP error responses**. Our error handling strategy addresses this multi-layered architecture:

```
Ignition → APIM → SAP S4/HANA
   ↑         ↑        ↑
Error     APIM      SAP Error
Handler   Wrapper   (Hidden)
```

**APIM Error Translation Challenge:**
- APIM may wrap, transform, or abstract actual SAP error codes
- HTTP status codes from APIM may not reflect true SAP business logic errors
- SAP-specific error details may be lost in APIM response transformation
- Timeout/retry logic must account for APIM proxy delays

### 2.2 Multi-Layered Error Detection & Classification

**Layer 1: APIM Response Analysis**
```python
# Error detection priority order
def analyze_apim_response(response):
    # 1. HTTP Status Code Analysis
    if response.status_code == 500:
        return "APIM_OR_SAP_SYSTEM_ERROR"  # Ambiguous - could be either
    elif response.status_code == 400:
        return "VALIDATION_ERROR"  # Could be APIM or SAP validation
    elif response.status_code == 429:
        return "APIM_RATE_LIMIT"  # Definitely APIM
    elif response.status_code == 504:
        return "APIM_TIMEOUT"  # APIM proxy timeout
    
    # 2. APIM Error Message Pattern Matching
    error_body = response.json()
    if "APIM" in error_body.get('source', ''):
        return classify_apim_error(error_body)
    elif "SAP" in error_body.get('error', {}).get('code', ''):
        return classify_sap_error(error_body)
    else:
        return "UNKNOWN_SOURCE_ERROR"  # Requires escalation
```

**Layer 2: SAP Business Logic Error Inference**
```python
# Infer SAP errors from APIM responses
def infer_sap_error(transaction_type, apim_response, transaction_data):
    """
    Since we cannot see raw SAP errors, infer likely SAP issues
    based on transaction context and APIM response patterns
    """
    if transaction_type == "PRODUCTION_CONFIRMATION":
        if "quantity" in apim_response.get('error', {}).get('message', ''):
            return {
                'likely_sap_error': 'CONFIRMATION_QUANTITY_INVALID',
                'business_action': 'Validate order remaining quantity',
                'user_message': 'Confirmation quantity exceeds order balance'
            }
    # Additional inference logic for each transaction type
```

**Layer 3: Transaction Context Error Validation**
```python
# Pre-validate transactions to prevent APIM/SAP errors
def validate_before_apim_call(transaction):
    """
    Comprehensive validation to catch errors before they reach APIM
    Reduces reliance on unclear APIM error responses
    """
    validations = [
        validate_order_exists(transaction.order_number),
        validate_quantity_available(transaction.confirmed_qty),
        validate_material_active(transaction.material),
        validate_plant_open(transaction.plant),
        validate_work_center_active(transaction.work_center)
    ]
    return aggregate_validation_results(validations)
```

### 2.3 Comprehensive Error Categories & Handling

| Error Source | Error Type | Detection Method | Recovery Strategy | Escalation |
|-------------|------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Network/Infrastructure** | Connection Timeout | HTTP timeout | Queue & retry (max 5x) | IT Operations |
| | DNS Resolution | Connection failure | Alternative endpoint | Network Team |
| **APIM Layer** | Rate Limiting | HTTP 429 | Exponential backoff | APIM Admin |
| | Authentication | HTTP 401/403 | Token refresh | Security Team |
| | Proxy Timeout | HTTP 504 | Extend timeout, retry | APIM Admin |
| | Transformation Error | HTTP 500 + APIM signature | Log for APIM team | APIM Support |
| **SAP S4/HANA (Inferred)** | Business Logic | Pattern matching in APIM response | User correction required | Business User |
| | Data Validation | HTTP 400 + SAP patterns | Pre-validation enhancement | Application Team |
| | Lock/Concurrency | Timeout + retry patterns | Delayed retry with jitter | System Admin |
| | Authorization | HTTP 403 + SAP context | Role verification | SAP Security |
| **Transaction Integrity** | Partial Success | Mixed success/failure in 4-step | Compensation logic | Supervisor |
| | Sequence Violation | Step N fails, steps 1-N-1 succeeded | Rollback procedures | Technical Lead |

### 2.4 APIM-Specific Error Handling Patterns

**Pattern 1: APIM Wrapping Detection**
```python
def unwrap_apim_error(apim_response):
    """
    Attempt to extract original SAP error from APIM wrapper
    """
    # Check for nested error structures
    if 'innerError' in apim_response:
        return extract_sap_error(apim_response['innerError'])
    
    # Check for SAP error code patterns in message
    sap_error_pattern = re.search(r'[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9]{3}', apim_response.get('message', ''))
    if sap_error_pattern:
        return lookup_sap_error_code(sap_error_pattern.group())
    
    # Fallback to APIM error handling
    return handle_generic_apim_error(apim_response)
```

**Pattern 2: Timeout Disambiguation**
```python
def analyze_timeout_source(start_time, response_time, timeout_error):
    """
    Determine if timeout occurred at APIM or SAP level
    """
    if response_time < 30:  # APIM typically fails fast
        return "APIM_PROXY_TIMEOUT"
    elif response_time > 120:  # SAP business logic timeout
        return "SAP_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT" 
    else:
        return "NETWORK_LATENCY_TIMEOUT"
```

**Pattern 3: Retry Strategy for APIM Environment**
```python
class APIMRetryStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_delay = 1  # seconds
        self.max_delay = 60  # seconds
        self.max_retries = 5
        
    def should_retry(self, error_type, attempt_count):
        # Never retry SAP business logic errors
        if error_type.startswith("SAP_BUSINESS_"):
            return False
            
        # Always retry APIM infrastructure issues
        if error_type in ["APIM_TIMEOUT", "APIM_CONNECTION_ERROR"]:
            return attempt_count < self.max_retries
            
        # Conditional retry for ambiguous errors
        if error_type == "HTTP_500_UNKNOWN_SOURCE":
            return attempt_count < 2  # Limited retries for unknown
            
        return False
    
    def get_delay(self, attempt_count, error_type):
        # Longer delays for SAP-inferred errors
        multiplier = 2 if error_type.startswith("SAP_") else 1
        return min(self.base_delay * (2 ** attempt_count) * multiplier, self.max_delay)
```

### 2.5 Enhanced Error Visibility & Monitoring

**APIM Error Correlation Framework:**
```python
def create_error_correlation_id(transaction):
    """
    Create correlation ID to track errors across APIM and Ignition
    """
    correlation_id = f"{transaction.order_number}_{transaction.timestamp}_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
    
    # Include in APIM headers
    headers = {
        'X-Correlation-ID': correlation_id,
        'X-Source-System': 'Ignition-MES',
        'X-Transaction-Type': transaction.type,
        'X-Plant-Code': transaction.plant
    }
    
    return correlation_id, headers
```

**Error Analytics Dashboard:**
- **APIM Error Rate Trends:** Track APIM-specific vs SAP-inferred errors
- **Timeout Analysis:** Categorize timeout sources (network/APIM/SAP)
- **Business Logic Error Patterns:** Identify recurring SAP validation issues
- **Retry Success Rates:** Monitor effectiveness of retry strategies
- **Correlation ID Tracking:** End-to-end transaction tracing

### 2.2 Transaction Integrity Management

**Four-Step Confirmation Process Integrity:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for transaction management
transaction_state = {
    'order_confirmed': False,
    'hu_created': False,
    'hu_packed': False,
    'gr_posted': False
}

# Each step validates previous steps
# Automatic rollback on failure
# Audit trail for all attempts
```

**Compensation Logic:**
- Step 4 fails → Unpack HU (Step 3 reverse)
- Step 3 fails → Delete HU (Step 2 reverse)
- Step 2 fails → Cancel confirmation (Step 1 reverse)
- Full audit trail maintained in Ignition

### 2.3 Error Recovery Queue

**Persistent Queue Implementation:**
- Local PostgreSQL database for failed transactions
- Automatic retry with configurable intervals
- Manual intervention options
- Age-based escalation
- Batch recovery tools

---

## 3. Data Caching & Offline Operation

   - Work center configurations
   - Last 24 hours of confirmations

2. **Level 2 - Operational Data** (Cached on-demand)
   - Historical orders (7 days)
   - Quality specifications
   - Customer requirements

3. **Level 3 - Reference Data** (Periodic sync)
   - Full material catalog
   - Customer database
   - Routing libraries

### 3.2 Offline Operation Capabilities

**Offline Functionality Matrix:**

| Function | Offline Capability | Data Sync on Reconnect | Business Impact |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| View Orders | Full | Not Required | None |
| Create Confirmations | Partial | Queued Upload | Delayed Visibility |
| Print Labels | Full | Not Required | None |

**Conflict Resolution:**
- S4/HANA is system of record
- Local changes queued with timestamps
- Supervisor approval for conflicts
- Automated resolution for non-conflicts

---

This SAP S4/HANA integration proposal provides a robust, risk-managed approach to achieving Project Phoenix objectives. By implementing a dual-path architecture with proven REST API technology as the primary integration method, we ensure the February 2026 deadline can be met regardless of emerging technology readiness. The comprehensive error handling framework fully supports S4's "Clean Core" principle, while the phased implementation approach allows for controlled deployment and risk mitigation.

Our solution prioritizes production readiness over bleeding-edge technology adoption, ensuring Owens Corning can successfully integrate the Masonite facilities while maintaining operational continuity and system reliability.
